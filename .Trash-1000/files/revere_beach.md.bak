Revere beach is, according to literally every sign and pamphlet I've seen of
it, America's *first and oldest* public beach. It's also one of the cleanest,
which is fairly easy to believe. While I have very little experience when it
comes to beaches, public or otherwise, I've heard many stories and jibs about
broken glass or needles, and I've never seen nearly anything like that here.
I usually look out for and pick up any trash I see, and it's never been more
than a handful per visit.

I'm happy to report that Revere Beach being *the oldest* public beach, while
a fact worthy of the moniker "fun", does not seem to truly matter to the beach
itself. There's no "old world charm", no monuments or obtrusive plaques. Just
a lovely beach, bars and restaurants with walk up windows to grab a quick bite,
and perhaps most importantly to me, a 1/2 mile walk to my house. Just about
everything I'm aware of to make for a good beach.

Until I moved to the area a few years ago for work, I'd never never really seen
the ocean in a meaningful way. I'd looked at it out the window of a plane, when
the whole world looks to a small, if detailed, diorama a scant 20 feet below.
I'd been *next to* the ocean, on my way to the airport. But I'd never *seen*
the ocean until I stepped up to that beach, and I was caught off-guard how
moving it really was.

In Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the book discusses
the idea of trying to perceive something "infinite". Because anything truly
infinite is essentially incomprehensible, it's much more effective to look at
something that is simply *very large*.

The phenomenon of an object shifting in your line of sight as you move and
change perspective is known as "parallax", and the "amount" of shift is a
function of distance and size. If something, say a cloud, is sufficiently large
or far away, there's nothing to compare the movement to and it doesn't seem to
move at all, meaning it can seem as though it's following you or matching your
pace.

I say all that to say that when I walked up to the ocean, it did not come
forward to meet me. It stayed where it was, as indifferent to my approach as it
is to any other kind of influence I may have on it. It stood immobile, yet
constantly moving, and waiting for nothing.

The little section of Revere Beach closest to my house is pretty much directly
in the middle. To the left (north on a map) there's an island with a lovely
city connected by an thin sand-bar with a bridge atop it a few miles out into
the water and a few miles away by land. To the right (south) the beach curves
out towards the water, giving the coast a nice crescent shape 

What this means is that when you stand at the water, to your right entire
beach streaches out before you, and ahead just on the horizon is a shining
city on the sea. And then you look around again and it's just a beach...

Turning away from the ocean and walking about a half mile will take you to
Rumney Marsh, a salt water marsh about 3 miles in diameter. I had seen it
on the map and knew it would be relatively large, but I didn't realize
until I saw it in person how *empty* it would be. Dead flat, not a single
tree, only one or two observation blinds. You can see clear across the
entire marsh from the edge.

For those grow up in an area as dense as east mass, I should explain that,
where I'm from, in between all of the cities there's *not-city*, whether
that be farms or fields or forests or what have you. Large, mostly green
areas with very few *buildings*, let alone *people*. To get from one city
to another, there'd be about half an hour of driving in not-city.

Contrast this with the Boston-Metro area, where everywhere in the 95 loop
(where I-95 loops around Boston, which I common use as a defacto "border")
there is essentially no border between cities other than lines on papers
in various city halls. There is no not-city, and you can't get more than
a quarter-mile away from some sort of house or building.

Everywhere, that is, except for the marsh.

When there's so much around you day in and day out, "nothing" can be truly
striking.

I should explain that when I say "my house", I mean my first house in
quite some time (almost 4 years) and my first mortgage. This is the first
time since moving out of my parents house almost a decade ago that I have
not had a landlord. I, like much of my own and later generations, was
unsure I'd *ever* own my own place up until just a few years ago.

Interesting fact: other than paying all of the people who facilitated
buying said house (i.e. closing costs) buying a house, in terms of total
next worth, is essential a wash. At the same time you go into a truly
unimaginable amount of debt, you gain an asset for (hopefully) roughly
equal value.

Suffice it to say, it don't really feel like that, but I won't go into
that now, although I do have words about it.
