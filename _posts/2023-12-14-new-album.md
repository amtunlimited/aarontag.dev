tl;dr: Go listen to [my new solo piano EP, Spare](https://amtunlimited.bandcamp.com/album/spare)

I probably should make a separate post for this, but I surprise-released a new solo piano EP a few weeks ago: Spare. If you've heard me improvise you probably know what this sounds like, but it's very contemplative. It's a compilation around a few themes I discovered while improvising live online over the course of a few weeks. 

For a little personal background, I was in a temporary living situation while I was searching for a new house and had very few of my things except my thoughts. Nothing by time to spare and little to distract me or work on, it was recorded in a time of transition. I wasn't convinced I was even going to release it but...I guess I did. I'm hoping someone can do something to sample them or whatever, that would be nice.

I'm hoping to do something interesting with it as well. I don't think I'll be releasing it widely, like on Spotify and all that. We'll see.

If you do listen to it, please [let me know what you think](mailto:aaron.tagliaboschi@gmail.com)
