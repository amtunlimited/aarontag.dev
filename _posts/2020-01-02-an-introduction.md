title: An Introduction

---
I consider myself a scientist, an engineer, and an artist. To some this sounds like 3 separate parts of one person, but I would disagree. I am tempted to call it a Venn diagram, with neat sections and categories. I wouldn't mind that. In reality it is much closer to a circular spectrum, like RGB. Each color able to mix freely with the others to create smooth, subtle, and complex variations. 

I am a great fan of the study of many things: music theory, illusions, science and generally the persuit of knowledge. The one thing I've heard from people about each of these fields is that they, in one form or another, remove the "magic" of the things I love. 

 * Math of rbg colorspace
 * Designer says it takes magic away
 * Layman says designer takes the magic away
 * Philistine might say that art as a whole is stupid and everyone above wastes their life
 * People who call digital art invalid
 * Boomer humor comic

Richard Feynman examiner this in an interview now called "The Beauty of a Flower", and he also embodied the opposite swing of this idea.

[Other stuff]

I want to use this space to talk about the thinks that I find beautiful, what why. To take some deep dives, or even just a scratch into the surface. Everything from Jazz to Computer Science to Math to Linguistics, and maybe even some regular ol pretty stuff. Whatever catches my fancy that I just want to gush about.
