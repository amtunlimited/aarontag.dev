*This post is directly inspired by [The Anthropocene Reviewed by John Green](https://www.amazon.com/Anthropocene-Reviewed-Signed-John-Green), and [a fan-made site](https://theanthropocenereviewed.com/) that maps locations of the book along with the reviews of those locations. The book is incredible, as is/was the podcast of its namesake. I personally highly recommend both.*

Revere beach is, according to literally every sign and pamphlet I've seen
of it, America's *first and oldest* public beach. It's also one of the
cleanest, which is fairly easy to believe. While I have very little
experience when it comes to beaches, public or otherwise, I've heard
many stories and jibs about broken glass or needles, and (thankfully) I've
never seen anything close to that here. I usually look out for and pick up
any trash I see, and it's never been more than a handful per visit.

I'm happy to report that Revere Beach being *the oldest* public beach,
while a fact worthy of the moniker "fun", does not seem to truly matter to
the beach itself. There's no ham-fisted "old world charm", no monuments or
obtrusive plaques to distract or clutter. It's just a lovely beach, with
bars and restaurants with walk up windows to grab a quick bite, and
perhaps most importantly to me, a 1/2 mile walk to my house. Just about
everything I'm aware of to make for a good beach.

Until I moved to the area a few years ago for work, I'd never never really
seen the ocean in a meaningful way. I'd looked at it out the window of
a plane, when the whole world looks to be a small, if detailed, diorama
a scant 20 feet below. I'd been *next to* the ocean, on my way to the
airport. But I'd never *seen* the ocean until I stepped up to that beach,
and I was caught off-guard how moving it really was.

In Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the book discusses
the idea of trying to perceive something "infinite". Because anything
truly infinite is essentially incomprehensible, the book posits that
a much more effective visual to look at something that is instead simply
*very large*.

The phenomenon of an object shifting in your line of sight as you move and
change perspective is known as "parallax", and the "amount" of shift is
a function of distance and size. If something, say a cloud, is
sufficiently large or far away, there's nothing to compare the movement
to and it doesn't seem to move at all, meaning it can seem as though it's
following you or matching your pace.

I say all that to say that when I walked up to the ocean, it did not come
forward to meet me. It stayed where it was, as indifferent to my approach
as it is to any other kind of influence I may have on it. It stood
immobile, yet constantly moving, and waiting for nothing.

The little section of Revere Beach closest to my house is pretty much
directly in the middle. To the left (north on a map) there's an island
with a lovely city connected by an thin sand-bar with a bridge atop it
a few miles out into the water and a few miles away by land. To the
right (south) the beach curves out towards the water, giving the coast
a nice crescent shape 

What this means is that when you stand at the water, to your right entire
beach stretches out before you, and ahead just on the horizon is a shining
city on the sea. And then you look around again and it's just a beach...

Turning away from the ocean and walking about a half mile will take you to
Rumney Marsh, a salt water marsh about 3 miles in diameter. I had seen it
on the map and knew it would be relatively large, but I didn't realize
until I saw it in person how *empty* it would be. Dead flat, not
a single tree, only one or two observation blinds. You can see clear
across the entire marsh from the edge.

For those grow up in an area as dense as east mass, I should explain that,
where I'm from, in between all of the cities there's *not-city*, whether
that be farms or fields or forests or what have you. Large, mostly green
areas with very few *buildings*, let alone *people*. To get from one city
to another, there'd be about half an hour of driving in not-city.

Contrast this with the Boston-Metro area, where everywhere in the 95 loop
(where I-95 loops around Boston, which I common use as a de facto
"border") there is essentially no border between cities other than lines
on papers in various city halls. There is no not-city, and you can't get
more than a quarter-mile away from some sort of house or building.

Everywhere, that is, except for the marsh.

When there's so much around you day in and day out, "nothing" can be truly
striking.

I should explain that when I say "my house", I mean my first house in
quite some time (almost 4 years) and my first mortgage. This is the first
time since moving out of my parents house almost a decade ago that I have
not had a landlord. I, like much of my own and later generations, was
unsure I'd *ever* own my own place up until just a few years ago.

Interesting fact: other than paying all of the people who facilitated
buying said house (i.e. closing costs) buying a house, in terms of total
next worth, is essential a wash. At the same time you go into a truly
unimaginable amount of debt, you gain an asset for (hopefully) roughly
equal value.

Suffice it to say, it doesn't really feel like that, but I won't go into
that now, although I do have words about it.

It's an interesting...we'll call it "privilege," having heard so many
tales and legends and such of the Ocean as some sort of character or will
of its, without having actually grown up around the ocean itself.
I imagine it's like seeing someone watch a classic movie you grew up with
for the first time.

Of course, seeing the ocean is one thing and feeling it is another. It's
very pretty, and very serene, and rather peaceful to just sit and look at
(at least my little slice is).

Then I walked up to the edge of the water and saw the swell. The entire
coastline, moving in an out by *yards*, faster and further than I could
jump in and out of the way. I walked in, and I felt that immense push and
pull, and then at some point, all of it sort of faded away and I simply
floated.

But of course, it didn't fade away. Even though the horizon had not moved
at all, the coast had left me behind by a fair amount. Now though, the
*entire ocean* was moving back and forth by meters and I was moving by
meters a second with it. I was simply so insignificant that I could barely
feel it. There was no resistance, no inertia in relation.

---

Many culture, one might even say *most*, bestow the Ocean some form of
personality or consciousness, or other anthropomorphic features. Sometimes
there might be a deity with the ocean as their domain, but just as often
the Ocean itself is a character with a capitol 'O'. If I had to take
a guess, I think it's difficult to conceptualize this complete form of
chaos. So completely outside the scope of any one human's influence, yet
so completely capable of wanton destruction with little to no resistance
even possible. Whether you're there or not, the waves will crash the same.
You are, as a person, completely unable to change that outcome and
therefore completely inconsequential to the process that set that wave in
motion.

That concept is probably difficult to grasp by our species as a whole, as
it challenges a very core notion that many people have, namely:

 - Humans are at "the top" 
 - Humans are at the top because of our intelligence and because of our
 stamina.
 - Our intelligence enables us to overcome the strength of other species.

Only we most certainly *cannot* overcome the might of the Ocean, all while
it has *no* intelligence to speak of. It's real life strange fiction,
a precursor to Lovecraft's cosmic horror.

Of course, we *have* conquered in some ways. Travel by sea is the backbone
of the world wide logistics network and has become, in a sense, mundane.

But "we" is a bit of a misnomer. Were I to walk that scant half mile to my
lovely slice of beach and simply keep walking, I would just disappear.
Nothing about the ocean would change in a meaningful way, but I would just
be *gone* without a single trace. Not a single fight.

This new house of mine has a window something knowingly big, with
a simmering city just out of reach...

It's quite beautiful, if a little terrifying.

4/5 star.
