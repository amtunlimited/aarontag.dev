To be very honest, I’m not terribly sure who reads these. If you do, I’d love to [hear from you](mailto:aaron.tagliaboschi@gmail.com). In the mean time, here’s what I’ve been up to.

## The Late Elephant In The Room

For the last few weeks, my wife’s health has been taking a down-turn that culminated in an emergency hospital stay that has lasted for the last week. She is doing much better, but the recovery is still ongoing.

Suffice it to say, progress for any projects is probably going to be scaled back for the next few months or so. I make no qualms about it nor do I apologize. At the same time, I think it would be a mistake from fully backing down on everything, creatively speaking. It’s helping.

Enough of that though, on to my various goings on.

## Music

I would say I’ve made fairly good progress on this end. I’ve completed the lyrics for 3 tunes with plenty more ideas in the works. As previously stated I already have one demo down, I’m hoping to have the rest of the lyrics and maybe a few more demos down.

I recently gave a listen to the album Discovery by Daft Punk. I’d heard many of the songs in isolation, but this was the first time I’d ever sat and listened to the album. It is absolutely ELECTRIFYING. Absolutely incredible versatility and musicianship, it was deeply inspiring as well. It makes me inch closer and closer to a classic house project.

On the TikTok side of things, I did manage to make a few, including a fun experiment were I [recorded a sample specifically for chopping](https://www.tiktok.com/@amtunlimited/video/7201716115255627054). This one in particular gave me something to think about and I think I’ll end up publishing an article about it soon(tm)

Speaking of writing…

## The Book

I’m glad to say I got a fair bit of this as well, although again not as much as I wanted. I did get somewhat of a skeleton done, although not enough of one to make a full book out of. I also got a little bit of writing done on it as well, and hopefully I’ll be able to share some of here along the way.

## Others

Unfortunately electronics is one aspect that fell completely by the wayside, and will likely continue to do so. I don’t quite have the time to dedicate with everything else going on and this is likely to be the lowest hanging fruit.

I’ve been baking and cooking a lot more recently. Not much to talk about there but I’ve greatly enjoyed it. For content, I’d highly recommend Adam Ragusea and J. Kenji Lopez Alt. For baking, King Arthur’s Baking Company is far and away the top tier.

I’ve been moved to a new team at work (just some headcount shifting) and so some light “onboarding” has made work a little more busy.

## Goals for March

The beginning of this month was…hectic to say the least, so I’m going to keep things light. I want:

- Lyrics finished for at least 5 songs for the EP
- Headway on the outline and possibly some more writing for the book.
